## Overview of Project:
"Catch-Up!"" is a website designed with busy professionals in mind. By entering your tasks, work time, and break time you can use "Catch-Up!"" to create a custom timer that will maximize your effectiveness and time management skills. 

There are only so many hours in a day! Let Catch-Up! help out. :tomato: 

## Project Background:
"Catch-Up!" is based on the "Pomodoro Technique" which was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique is based upon six underlying principles.
* **Decide on a task to be done**
* **Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes)**
* **Work on the task**
* **End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper**
* **If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3-5 minutes) then go to step 2**
* **After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1**


## Programming Languages used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
